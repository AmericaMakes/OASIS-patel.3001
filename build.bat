REM Change line 22, which calls vcvarsall.bat, to the location of this file on your machine.
REM The x64 switch as well as Release/x64 switches on msbuild are required because this
REM Visual Studio solution is only set up with correct paths under that configuration
REM
REM USAGE:
REM 	Send in the code directory as a parameter in double-quotes when executing this file from command line
REM For example, on the author's machine this would be
REM 	compileBaseCode.bat "C:\Users\200008936\Documents\GitHub\OASIS-Challenge-Baseline-Code-and-Models\OASIS baseline source code\OASIS baseline source"
REM
REM The solution file should appear in that folder.  The solution filename, configuration
REM and platform are hard coded in the msbuild command
