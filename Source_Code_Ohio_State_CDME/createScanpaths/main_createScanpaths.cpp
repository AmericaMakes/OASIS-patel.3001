main_createScanpaths.cpp contains the main() function of the basic user interface
for the scanpath generation program, createScanpaths.exe, which
in turn calls executables for layer generation (genLayer.exe)
and scanpath generation (genScan.exe).  This is the only executable
which should be accessed directly by end users; the other two executables
should not be called directly since they do not provide an interface
to select configuration files (and also assume that error checking
on the configuration file has already been performed)
